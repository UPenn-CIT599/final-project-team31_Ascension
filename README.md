Welcome to Tower Game (title TBD), a project by David Cai, Shari Sinclair, and Jiayu Vivienne Zhu.

This is a turn-based RPG in which the player aims to climb a tower to reach the treasure.

On your way, you will encounter various monsters, secret mechanics, a varied shop, and a final boss.

Best part of it is no two plays will be the same thanks to controlled randomization of stat generation and minion generation.

Choose from 3 classes, warrior, mage, and ranger, and experience different playstyles through unique stat focuses and unique battle perks.

Will you succeed?

To test out GUI, run GameGUI. To check out our current test cases, run GameCharactersTest as a JUnit. We are currently building out the GUI and linking functionality with the game logic. Furthermore, we use a console-based version of our game in the Runner class in order to rapidly prototype, test features, and balance mechanics. This class will be commented out as it will be deprecated upon GUI completion and will not be incorporated into the nature of the project's design.
