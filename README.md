#Welcome to Tower Game (title TBD)
## A project by David Cai, Shari Sinclair, and Jiayu Vivienne Zhu.

This is a turn-based RPG in which the player aims to climb a 10 floor tower to reach the treasure.

On your way, you will encounter various monsters, mysterious events, secret mechanics, an elusive magic shop, and a final boss.

Th best part of it is that no two plays will be the same thanks to controlled randomization of stats, minion generation, and special events.

Choose from 3 classes: warrior, mage, and rogue, and experience different playstyles through unique stat focuses and battle perks.

**Will you succeed?**

## How to Play
1. **Start:** After the Start screen, select the class of hero you would like to play with. If you hover over the class of hero hyou can see the differences in stats. A mage has the benefit of limited powerful magic attacks, the warrior has increased stamina and defence, and the Rogue has the advantage of a swift double attack. Next, enter a name for the hero. 

2. **Floors and Enemies:** You will enter floor 1 of the tower. Each floor of the tower will have will have the same display and controls (seen below) but will have differing randomly generated enemies. Enemy types can either be the defensive hrd hitting Melee enemy, the magical Ranged enemy, and the Healer enemy who can heal the most weakened enemy on the floor. Floor 1-3 will have enemies, Floor 4-6 will have 2 enemies, and Floor 7-9 will have 3. The final floor, 10, will have the Boss enemy. 

3. **Controls:** Each character will have an __Attack, Defend, Heal__ button, and Mages will have and additional Magic Atk button. The Attack button allows you to atack the enemy of choice each turn. Just click the Attack button above the correstponding enemy to tell you hero who to attack.

To test out GUI, run GameGUI. To check out our current test cases, run GameCharactersTest as a JUnit. We are currently building out the GUI and linking functionality with the game logic. Furthermore, we use a console-based version of our game in the Runner class in order to rapidly prototype, test features, and balance mechanics. This class will be commented out as it will be deprecated upon GUI completion and will not be incorporated into the nature of the project's design.
